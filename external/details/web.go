// WebDetail handles managing the frontend aspects of the ghatd framework.

// [WebDetail.X] should

// [WebDetail.Initialise]
// [Handler.ServeHTTP] should write reply headers and data to the [ResponseWriter] and then return. Returning signals that the request is finished; it is not valid to use the [ResponseWriter] or read from the [Request.Body] after or concurrently with the completion of the ServeHTTP call.

// Depending on the HTTP client software, HTTP protocol version, and any intermediaries between the client and the Go server, it may not be possible to read from the [Request.Body] after writing to the [ResponseWriter]. Cautious handlers should read the [Request.Body] first, and then reply.

// Except for reading the body, handlers should not modify the provided Request.

// If ServeHTTP panics, the server (the caller of ServeHTTP) assumes that the effect of the panic was isolated to the active request. It recovers the panic, logs a stack trace to the server error log, and either closes the network connection or sends an HTTP/2 RST_STREAM, depending on the HTTP protocol. To abort a handler so the client sees an interrupted response but the server doesn't log an error, panic with the value [ErrAbortHandler].
