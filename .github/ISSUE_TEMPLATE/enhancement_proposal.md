Do you have an idea how this could be implemented? If so, have you considered creating a PR with your thoughts/ PoC?

This is a new project, with exciting goals, and we are looking to build a community so we can leverage each other's skills, experience and thoughts to push boundaries on GHAT(D). Why not create a PoC PR and reference it to your proposal, we won't bite (I promise), or reach out to me
